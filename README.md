# ISC-4933:  Iterative and Direct Solvers for Linear Systems

## Course Description
Linear systems play a central role in countless problems including partial differential equations,
inverse problems, and data analysis. Performing a matrix-vector multiplication, matrix inversion,
or matrix factorization is computationally expensive if applied in its textbook form. This course will
explore iterative and direct algorithms that accelerate these basic tasks. Examples of algorithms
that may be covered include multigrid, fast summation methods, preconditioners, incomplete LU,
interpolative decomposition, randomized algorithms, and low-rank factorizations.

## Compilation

To compile run:
```
make
```

Note compilation time might be longer than usual because the document contains the source code for 
all of the figures.

To remove all generated files run
```
make clean
```
