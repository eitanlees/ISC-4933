\section{Preconditioners}

Let $A$ be s.p.d.\ and suppose we are solving $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$. Suppose we have some matrix $P$ with $P\approx A$. Then, the preconditioned linear system is

\begin{equation*}
    P^{-1}A\vec{x} = P^{-1}\vec{b},
\end{equation*}
where $P$ is called the preconditioner. There are two properties that are required of a good preconditioner

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
    \item $P^{-1}$ can be applied efficiently.
    \item $P\approx A$ or $P^{-1}A\approx I$
\end{enumerate}
